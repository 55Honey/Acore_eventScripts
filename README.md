Lua script for Azerothcore with ElunaLUA to spawn (custom) NPCs and grant them scripted combat abilities

#### Find me on patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Honeys

## Requirements:

Compile your [Azerothcore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) with [Eluna Lua](https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue-details.html?id=131435473).
The ElunaLua module itself usually doesn't require much setup/config. Just specify the subfolder where to put your lua_scripts in its .conf file.

If the directory was not changed in the ElunaLua config, add the .lua script to your `../lua_scripts/` directory as a subfolder of the worldserver.
Adjust the top part of the .lua file with the config flags.
