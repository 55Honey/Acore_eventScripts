## EventScripts
LUA script for Azerothcore with ElunaLUA to extend dungeons mobs/bosses abilities and log kills.


## Requirements:

Compile your [Azerothcore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) with [Eluna Lua](https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue-details.html?id=131435473).
The ElunaLua module itself usually doesn't require much setup/config. Just specify the subfolder where to put your lua_scripts in its .conf file.

If the directory was not changed in the ElunaLua config, add the .lua script to your `../lua_scripts/` directory as a subfolder of the worldserver.
Adjust the top part of the .lua file with the config flags.
